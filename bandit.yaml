# =============================================================================
# Bandit SAST Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code.
# This configuration customizes the security scan for our project.
#
# Why SAST?
# - Detects code-level security vulnerabilities early in development
# - Identifies OWASP Top 10 issues like SQL injection, hardcoded secrets
# - Shift-left security: find issues in code, not in production
# =============================================================================
